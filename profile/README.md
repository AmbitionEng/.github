## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're [Ambition](https://ambition.com), makers of next-generation sales performance software.

We compute and store billions of sales metrics. Many of our open source libraries here help us leverage advanced techniques with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/):
- Triggers with [django-pgtrigger](https://django-pgtrigger.readthedocs.io)
- Audit trails and event logs with [django-pghistory](https://django-pgtrigger.readthedocs.io)
- High performance upserts, copies, and updates with [django-pgbulk](https://django-pgbulk.readthedocs.io)
- Advisory locks with [django-pglock](https://django-pgbulk.readthedocs.io)

We're also the makers of [Qik](https://qik.build), our in-house tooling to manage our large monorepo.

## We're hiring ðŸš€

We need people that are obsessed with solving extremely challenging data problems. If interested, [send us an email](mailto:wes.kendall@ambition.com) with examples of exceptional work you've done.
